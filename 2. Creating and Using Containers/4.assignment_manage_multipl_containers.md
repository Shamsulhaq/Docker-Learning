## Assignment Manage Multipl Containers

Now we have to play around of container command. Now out assignment is start up multiple container and we gonnal go to some other process. And set up multiple types of images in different container at the same time.

- docs.docker.com
- `--help`
- google.com

So we gonna start up three container application. We are not actually go to set up this three diffrent containers with application data or source file. But we just start that how to diffrent and managing to this data. 

- Run a nginx, a mysql and a httpd (apache) server
- Run all of them --detach (or -d), name them with --name
- nginx should listen on 80:81, httpd on 80:80, mysql on 3306:3306
- When running mysql, use the --env option (or -e) to pass in MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes
- User docker container logs on mysql to find the random password it created on startup.
- Clean it all up with docke rcontainer stop and docker container rm (both can accept multiple names or ID's)
- User docker container ls and ls -a to ensure everything is correct before and after cleanup.

## Assignment Answere

Now we gonna solve the assignemnt.

Command: `docker container run -d -p 3306:3306 name db -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes mysql`

> a1ce5c766a17e94f20ede6cc008012a5dac7d2f6d7b83a0694942127d4f62257`

Commant: `docker container run -d --name webserver -p 8181:80 httpd`

> 04b27242e48bdef3e7d7ec7d9a130e940b203e7e9d359ab1c121189db07744f4

Command: `docker container run -d --name ngserver -p 8282:80 nginx`

> 3af53bec6ac4747040ad0619487dc4550280a1a5fb82f2d6585a265c29e70150

Now if we check then we will see three contaienr is running.

Command: 
```
docker ps  (Old command)
docker container ls
```

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                               NAMES

```

If we `curl` the pages then we see its works.

Command: `curl loclhost:8181`  # for apache
Command: `curl loclhost:8282`  # for nginx

Now we have to stop all server with.

Command: `docker container stop 7f1e 04b27 a1ce`

Now if we check then we will see server is stoped.

Command: `docker container ls -a`

Now we have to clean data. Then assignment will done.

Command: `docker container rm 7f1e 04b27 a1ce`

Now we check we will see all data is clean.

Command: `docker container ls -a`
