# Getting a Shell Inside Containers (No Need for SSH)

Requirments for this lecture are that you knwo how to start a container form previous section. We just finished the last lecture thalking about seeing what is going on in a container from the outside. This is all about getting into a container to mess around the inside. There is a few commands,

- `docker container run -it`
    + start enw contaienr interactively.
- `docker container exes -it`
    + run additional command in existing.
- Different Linux distros in containers

We will talk about hwo the `-it` works to actually get a shell inside the container. Then for running containers that you want to run a second process, you can also use the container exec and we will show several examples of that.

Then along the way we are going to actually mentaion a few differences between a regulat Linux distribution, like Ubuntu for installing on a virtual machine or on hardware. And then what those LInux distros are like inside of a container.

Command:
```
docker container run -d --name nginx nginx
docker container run -d --name mysql -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=true mysql
docker container ls
```

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                 NAMES
fd1752b5001e        mysql               "docker-entrypoint.s…"   19 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds       3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   mysql
f80a9722e213        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon of…"   35 seconds ago      Up 32 seconds       80/tcp                nginx
```

We are going to specigy a few extra option with run command.

Command: `docker container run -it --name poroxy nginx bash`

The `-it` is actually two separate options.

If we doocer container run `-it`, and then run another nginx. Then we are going to have to specify an alternate command. If you remamber at the begining of this section where we talked about the format of the docker command line, when you are doing a docker container run, as you can see through the help, here at the end, after the image, you hae optional command and arguments that you can send in to the new container that you are about to start to tell it what you run. Thime image has a default command in it that we will see later how to configure.

BUt if you wanted to change what was run on startup you can do that right from the run command. Let's just say Bash. Becasue Bash is one of the command shells that you would usually find in a container that will give you a shell to work with.

> Note: If we run with -it, it will give us a teerminal inside the running container.

![container-it-bash](/home/jaki/Dev/Docker_learning/2. Creating and Using Containers/images/container-it-bash.png)

You will notice out prompt syss root which is the user that the container started as. It does not actually mean I am root on the host. It just means I am acting as root on the container. The number after it is actually the container ID.

If We do a `ls -al`, We get a full listing of everything where I am at.

Command: `ls -al`

Now we can see that I am in the root path of the file system inside the container. I am actually looking at all the files inside the container which in based on the Nginx image. From here, I could go change config files, I could download packages from the internet and do just about any common administrative thing that we woild do from a normal shell.

Now get out of the shell and just type `exit`. Like you would with any shell and now that container is stopped. If we type,

Command: `docker container ls`

We will not see it but If you type

Command: `docker container ls -a`

Then we will see proxy image. Now see the command that it run. The default command for an Nginx container is to run the the Nginx program itself. But when we typed out last command, we changed that default program to actually be Bash, which gave us our shell. When we exited the shell, the container stopped. Because contaienr only run as long as the commadn that it ran on startup runs. Shince we changed it to Bash, simply exiting Bash quit.

If we used a full distribution of Linux instead of actually doing the Nginx. Let's do a full Ubuntu.

Command: `docker container run -it --name ubuntu ubuntu`

It is actually going to download the ubuntu image and place me in the prompt of this new container. We are already familler with Ubuntu and we know the apt package manager.

So I can use that here. Just like I would in a standard Ubuntu server. Here We can use like just ubuntu terminal.

The thing about Ubuntu and other distributions inside a container is that they are usually very minimal. A live CD or a download of the ISO of Ubuntu which you would normally put on a virtual machine is going to have a lot more software installed by default than a Ubuntu container which is really a very minimal version of Ubuntu that you can always add more software to with the apt package manager.

When we get out the container with `exit` command then the container is stoped.

Command: `docker container ls`

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                 NAMES
fd1752b5001e        mysql               "docker-entrypoint.s…"   4 hours ago         Up 4 hours          3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   mysql
f80a9722e213        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon of…"   4 hours ago         Up 4 hours          80/tcp                nginx
```

But if we check `docker container ls -a` then you will see all the container image thats you running. But if you started ubuntu image again then you will see your old setting was there.

But If we created a new container from the Ubuntu image, that different container would not have your odl packege installed. Because it will be newly ubuntu image.

What if we wanted to rerun that container and get Bash righ back in it again. We could use the `docker container start command`. You will notice its slightly different when we start an existing container, but it is similar to the it.. It's ust an ai.

Command: `docker container start -ai ubuntu`

Now we `exit` then you get out.

What if I want ot actually see the shell inside a running container that is already running something like MySQL or Nging. And that's using the exec command.

Command: `docker container exec --help`

```
  -d, --detach               Detached mode: run command in the background
      --detach-keys string   Override the key sequence for detaching a container
  -e, --env list             Set environment variables
  -i, --interactive          Keep STDIN open even if not attached
      --privileged           Give extended privileges to the command
  -t, --tty                  Allocate a pseudo-TTY
  -u, --user string          Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
  -w, --workdir string       Working directory inside the container
```

We can see we have a few option here. I want to jump into the mySQL container because I need to do some administrative stuff on the MySQL itself. I could do the it again and then the name of the container. Then the program I want to run.

Command: `docker container exec -it mysql bash`

And in this case again it is Bash and I am now in the container with MySQL. I can actually do a ps aux right inside the container which lists the processes. If you check `ps aux` You will see mysql is running.

You will notice when we `exit` this Bash shell and do an `ls`, MySQL is still running. Because the `docker container exec` actually runs an additional process on an existing running container. It is not going to affect the root process for the MySQL demon.

When we need to change something slightly on a running system, as well as using containers of different distributions to give you the environment you would have if you had a full machine like a Ubuntu or **Alpine**.

> Now what's **Apline**? We have not mentioned Apline before. **Alpine** is another distribution of Linux, but Alpine is designed to be very small. It's actually only 5MB in size.

If We do a `docker pull apline`, that will pull down the latest **Apline** image and if I do a `docker image ls`, you can actually see how small the Alpine image is compared to the Ubuntu.

```
docker pull apline
docker image ls
```

`alpine              latest              196d12cf6ab1        3 months ago        4.41MB`

The neat thing about Alpine is that it also comes with its won package manager. So you will see Alpine as an option on **Docker Hub** alot in the next section when we go over **images** and and **Docekr Hub**. But for now let's do a Bash shell inside of Alpine.

Command: `docker container run -it alpine bash`

But maybe you get an error just like me!
`docker: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:348: starting container process caused "exec: \"bash\": executable file not found in $PATH": unknown.`

- Why did I get in there? What is the error?
- It tells us that it is starting the container process and it caused the executable file bash to not be found in the path. And what that really means is that Bash is not in the container. And this goes back to the concept that we can only run things in the container that already exists in its image. When we started it. Or mybe something that you have added later through the exec or run commands.

But in this case, how would I get in the Apline image? Alpine is so small that it does not actually have Bash in it. But it does have **sh.** So we can replace the command with **sh**, which is not quite as full featured as Bash but does get us right into the container.

Command: `docker container run -it alpine sh`

If we were to search Alpine Linux in the internet you would learn that its package manager is **apk** and we could actually use that to install Bash if we realy needed it.

## Recape this lesson.

- We learned about the `-it` option for contaienr run, which gives us the equivalent of an interactive shell to actually do things in the container as we would if we are ssh'd in to a server of some sort.
- We learned a new command for `docker contaiern exec` with `-it` that does exactly the same thing as run, but it does it on an existing container that is running not starting a new container.
- We learned a little but about Apline and how that is different from major Linux distrubutions and how it is actually like 5MB in size and ideal for contaienr images.
